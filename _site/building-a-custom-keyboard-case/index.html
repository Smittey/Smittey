				<p>I’ve talked before about my weird hobbies and interests. I have a collection of random impulse buys that would probably baffle future archiologists if the earths population and records were almost completely erased. One of these interests is the wonderful land of mechanical keyboards.</p>

<p>This somewhat niche and geeky field is unknown even to a lot of folk in my profession; the inheritently geeky and nerdy software development practise. Owning a mechnical keyboard (or keyboards for the somewhat obsessed) have an array of advantages which I plan to talk about in another blog post, but for now I want to enthuse about customisation.</p>

<p><img src="/img//post-custom-keyboard-case-keycaps.jpg" alt="Keyboard with custom keycaps" title="Keyboard with custom keycaps" /></p>

<p>You can customise most mechanical keyboards from everything from keycap colour, to switch type, key mappings, and casing. After being inspired by DIY projects spotted around the Internet (mainly the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY/" target="_blank">DIY</a> and <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/mechanicalkeyboards" target="_blank">MechanicalKeyboard</a> subreddits) and somewhat put off by the outrageous cost of purchasing one, I thought I’d attempt to make a wooden keyboard case myself. Being my first woodwork project since school, I was nervous. I documented the process fairly well, so what follows is my build log! Enjoy.</p>

<h4 id="the-finished-product">The finished product</h4>

<h4 id="materials-used">Materials used</h4>

<ul>
  <li>Slab of wood, purchased from B&amp;Q</li>
  <li>Handheld router</li>

  <li>Sandpaper (course, medium, and fine)</li>
  <li>Cork sanding block</li>
  <li>Stained varnish</li>
  <li>Paintbrush</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="build-log">Build Log</h4>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>I started by taking the keyboard to a hardware shop to ensure that I was buying wood of adequate size. Warning: This will attract strange looks from other shoppers.
<img src="/img/post-building-a-custom-keyboard-case/01.jpg" alt="Measuring the keyboard against wood in the hardware shop" title="Measuring the keyboard against wood in the hardware shop" /></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I removed all of the keys from the board and penciled an outline on the wood. This is the pilot line for when I do the routing. I made sure to indent this somewhat in case of a drastic error.
<img src="/img/post-building-a-custom-keyboard-case/02.jpg" alt="About to start measuring" title="About to start measuring" /></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I prepared the router and adjusted the height of the bit in order to get the desired depth in the wood.
<img src="/img/post-building-a-custom-keyboard-case/03.jpg" alt="Getting the router ready" title="Getting the router ready" /></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is the result from the first cut with the router. I suspected that this would be trial and error to a certain degree as I wasn’t sure how deep it would have to be or how it would turn out. Probably just as well that I needed to go deeper as I made a pigs ear of this.
<img src="/img/post-building-a-custom-keyboard-case/04.jpg" alt="First cut" title="First cut" /></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This it the result of the second deeper cut. The board fits better in it now.
<img src="/img/post-building-a-custom-keyboard-case/05.jpg" alt="Second cut with keyboard placed in it" title="Second cut with keyboard placed in it" /></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A circular saw was used to cut the wood close to the route to give a nice close bezel. This ended up being a lot closer than intended. Dangerously so.
<img src="/img/post-building-a-custom-keyboard-case/06.jpg" alt="Second cut with keyboard placed in it" title="Second cut with keyboard placed in it" /></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>From another angle…
<img src="/img/post-building-a-custom-keyboard-case/07.jpg" alt="Second cut with keyboard placed in it" title="Second cut with keyboard placed in it" /></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>And another…

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Cutting the cable hole was undocumented mainly because I was convinced that it wouldn’t work. The hole was created by drilling smaller spaced holes through the wood, and knocking it through with a chisel. I then used the chisel to smooth it out and clean it up. Note: If I had access to the correct tools I would use a coping saw or similar.
<img src="/img/post-building-a-custom-keyboard-case/09.jpg" alt="Using a chisel to smooth out the wood" title="Using a chisel to smooth out the wood" /></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The result of placing the keyboard back into the wood and plugging it in. It fits! This needs to be properly cleaned up.
<img src="/img/post-building-a-custom-keyboard-case/10.jpg" alt="Cable fitting through the hole" title="Cable fitting through the hole" /></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I then used a power sander to smooth out the wood. This is the first of many rounds of sanding as I plan to hand-sand it before varnishing.
<img src="/img/post-building-a-custom-keyboard-case/11.jpg" alt="Sanding the board" title="Sanding the board" /></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Placing the keycaps back on the keyboard! Let’s see how this bad boy looks so far…

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The unvarnished board! Next step is to sand it and coat it with varnish.
<img src="/img/post-building-a-custom-keyboard-case/14.jpg" alt="Unvarnished board" title="Unvarnished board" /></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I call this the ‘I have no idea what I’m doing’ picture. I think I stood here for the best part of an hour.

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Let the second round of sanding begin! A lot of imperfections needed sanding out with varied grit levels.
<img src="/img/post-building-a-custom-keyboard-case/16.jpg" alt="Starting the second round of sanding" title="Starting the second round of sanding" /></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>More sanding!
<img src="/img/post-building-a-custom-keyboard-case/17.jpg" alt="More sanding!" title="More sanding!" /></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Even more sanding.
<img src="/img/post-building-a-custom-keyboard-case/18.jpg" alt="Even more sanding." title="Even more sanding." /></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This desperately needed sorting out. The cable hole is now a bit tidier!
<img src="/img/post-building-a-custom-keyboard-case/19.jpg" alt="Cleaning up the cable hole" title="Cleaning up the cable hole" /></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Wiping the board down after the sanding. This removes all of the sawdust and general dirt from the wood in preparation for varnishing.
<img src="/img/post-building-a-custom-keyboard-case/20.jpg" alt="Wiping the board" title="Wiping the board" /></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>About to start the varnishing! I chose a coloured varnish because I couldn’t justify spending money on wood stain as well as varnish. This two in one seemed more sensible.
<img src="/img/post-building-a-custom-keyboard-case/21.jpg" alt="About to start the varnishing" title="About to start the varnishing" /></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This turned out awful. I have to admit, I was pretty worried after I did this. I put it on wayyyyyy too thick, and thought it was too dark. It was just a good job that I did it in a place that would be hidden!
<img src="/img/post-building-a-custom-keyboard-case/22.jpg" alt="First bit of varnishing" title="First bit of varnishing" /></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I waited until the routed bit had dried and it didn’t actually look too bad. It dried a lot lighter so I did the rest of the board. This is the result of the first layer of varnishing. At this point I’m not too sure if I want to apply more coats due to the fact that it will get a lot darker with each coat. This also massively accentuated every imperfection in the routed part of the board. You can really see how bad I did this!
<img src="/img/post-building-a-custom-keyboard-case/23.jpg" alt="First later of varnish" title="First later of varnish" /></p>
