Three years ago I was the fittest and strongest I have ever been. I was on my placement year during University, lived five minutes from where I was worked, and was going to the gym four-five times per week. 

Once the year was finished, I returned back to University to complete my degree in Computer Science and continued to frequent the gym, albeit not as much. Despite spending on the up of 10 hours per day sitting at a computer of some description I wasn't suffering from any discomfort such as back pain; something that course-mates and old workmates regularly complained about. I always put this down to the fact that I had a very strong core as a result of doing (by this point) two solid years of weight training at the gym. Since then I've returned to the same company as a full Graduate and onto a different project situated in another office more than an hours drive away. This has meant that the time I've been able to dedicate to personal fitness tanked spectacularly. Within the past 6 months the amount of discomfort I've suffered (particularly in my back) has went from exactly 0 to at least a once per week affair. 

If you're in the industry yourself, you'll appreciate how little you're required to leave your desk aside from out of your own will (unless you're more in management with meetings left, right and centre), and as a result can easily spend extended periods of time sitting in one place (with perhaps not the most ideal posture). 

It really does sound clich√©, one thing I've taken from this is that physical exercises are just as important as mental exercises in this industry. Today marks day one back after a long hiatus from the gym and I feel safe in the knowledge that my back isn't going to ache at least for the next 3-4 days. I know this because the overall body pain resulting from today's session is going to massively outweigh the discomfort caused by my back.
